### 🧠🌸 Iris Species Predictor – ML Web App using Flask

A fun and interactive web application that uses a trained machine learning model to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features.

🌼 **Features:**

* 🎯 Predicts Iris species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*
* 🧪 Input via animated sliders for petal and sepal measurements
* 🎨 Colorful, cartoon-style UI with emojis and motion
* 🗣️ Text-to-speech support with child-like voice narration
* ⚙️ Built with Flask + Joblib + HTML/CSS + JavaScript
* 📦 Includes a trained model using the famous Iris dataset

---

### 📊 Input Parameters:

* Sepal Length (cm)
* Sepal Width (cm)
* Petal Length (cm)
* Petal Width (cm)

---

### 🚀 How It Works:

1. User adjusts sliders to input flower dimensions
2. App sends data via `POST` to the Flask backend
3. Trained model predicts the Iris species
4. Result is displayed along with a speaker button for narration

---

### 💡 Technologies Used:

* Flask (Python backend)
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)
* scikit-learn & joblib (Model & serialization)
* Web Speech API (Voice narration)
